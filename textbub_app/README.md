### User Stories for Service Providers:
#### Authentication

* As a user, I should be able to signup for the application with all fields a service provider would need, address, hours of operation, and create a unique handle.
* As a user, I should be able to log in if I already have an account.
* As a user, if I have previously set up my profile (profile set up is below), after I log-in I should be directed to my profile page which displays my name, the service I provide, the city of my service, a list of reviews of my service, my review text number, a short about me section my profile pic [stretch goal] , and an html section with a cut and pasteable code that will display easily on other sites [stretch goal].

* As a text reviewer, I should be able to text textbub a review at that handle
